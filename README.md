# XBIM - Wpf Export/Conversion application

## What is it?

The xBIM Tookit (eXtensible Building Information Modelling) is an open-source, software development BIM toolkit that 
supports the BuildingSmart Data Model (aka the [Industry Foundation Classes IFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes)).

This application uses the features of the toolkit to generate COBie (in different formats) from BIM files.

https://github.com/CBenghi/Xbim.COBieLiteUK.WpfClient.git is its temporary home, with a plan to move it to Xbim.Exchange once working.
